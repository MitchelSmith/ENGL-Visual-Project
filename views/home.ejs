            <h3>About Our Community</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>Founded many years ago, Pinnacle Lane has a rich and mysterious history. One of the first major residents
                        of our community was a man named Captain de Dores. His contributions to the community helped us to
                        become what we are today. According to the local historical society, he helped fund the construction
                        of many of our local buildings and threw lavish celebrations all for his young sister. The ultimate
                        end of this family is unknown, but there is no doubt they left their mark.</p>
                    <p>As the years went by we've had many residents and businesses come and go, but all have helped us become
                        what we strive to be, a friendly and prospering locality. We are always trying to achieve this goal,
                        as well as surpassing it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>Our locale hosts a variety of buildings and businesses such as Emilienne's Bakery, Pinnacle Elementary,
                        our recently remodeled police station, and various neighborhoods with notable families such as the
                        Griffiths and Lavenders.</p>
                    <p>It is true that we are a quaint, little hamlet in the large city of Seattle, but what we lack in size
                        we more than make up for in character. Our annual Solstice Festival draws crowds from all over the
                        state and for good reason. When you visit Pinnacle Lane you'll be greeted with friendly smiles and stories, and when you leave you'll be planning your next trip back. </p>
